Sandpit to test out css variables and streamlining the themeing feature for future applications.

I've whittled the colours down to **11** for now, might streamline further later.

The current naming convention is a little generic - it doesn't say if the colours are accents, highlights or dark.

There is a **base** colour and from there, it goes 5 scales up (numbered **1++**) or 5 scales down (numbered **0++**).

For now, I'm assuming that numbers going up is lighter and numbers going down is darker.

From here, you can append with alpha if you wish; ie. **base00_50** is the lowest or darkest colour with a 50% transparency.

[Google's Material Design colour palette](https://www.materialpalette.com) has proven to be the most useful palette picker out there (I've tried quite a few - most are, bizarrely, limited to 5 colours and have rather clunky user interfaces).
